## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14+)
- PostgreSQL (v12+)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AxelSeanCP/Forum-API.git
   cd Forum-API
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables:**

   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your configurations:

   ```plaintext
    # HTTP SERVER
    HOST=localhost
    PORT=5000

    # POSTGRES
    PGHOST=localhost
    PGUSER=your-user
    PGDATABASE=forumapi
    PGPASSWORD=your-password
    PGPORT=5432

    # POSTGRES TEST
    PGHOST_TEST=localhost
    PGUSER_TEST=your-user
    PGDATABASE_TEST=forumapi_test
    PGPASSWORD_TEST=your-password
    PGPORT_TEST=5432

    # TOKENIZE
    ACCESS_TOKEN_KEY=your-key
    REFRESH_TOKEN_KEY=your-key
    ACCCESS_TOKEN_AGE=your-token-age

   ```

4. **Initialize the database:**

   Make sure PostgreSQL is running, and create the initial tables:

   ```bash
   npm run migrate up
   ```

### Running the Server

Start the server locally:

```bash
npm run start
```

Your server should be running on `http://localhost:5000`.
